## Installation
You must have inquirer 8.2.4 installed to make this work!

The name and location of your file will be markdown_output.md @ UW_Read_Me_Generator/Develop/. The content can either be copy and pasted into a default README.md, or you can rename it README.md and overwrite the default GitHub README.md.
